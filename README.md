 Hello guys, today i want to show you how to use "DragoDumper" functions in C++. So first of all, if you want to use my project you need to install CodeBlocks and import my project into it. After this, you must to install python 2.7 in your computer to include python library and python directory in codeblocks for use "Python" environment. I created the program on x32 bytes but if you want on x64 must to config compiler for this.
